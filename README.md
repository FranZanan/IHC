# IHC
## This repository presents the index of hydrosedimentological connectivity (IHC) (Zanandrea et al., 2021) created from the equation of the connectivity index (IC) by Borselli et al. (2008) modified by Cavalli et al. (2013). The utility available here is a Toolbox for ArcGIS 10.3, generated from the modification of the Sediment Connectivity tool implemented by Crema and Cavalli (2018). The repository also has a guideline that has a brief explanation of the IHC conceptualization, as well as a presentation of its equation.  The guide also introduces the ArcGIS Toolbox for the IHC execution, its installation, and how to apply it to watersheds.
